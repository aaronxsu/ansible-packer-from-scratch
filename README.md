# ansible-packer-from-scratch

I have started learning to create roles using an Ansible Playbook to configure VMs. This repo is a simply implementation following a two-part tutorial posted [here](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2014/10/09/creating-ansible-roles-from-scratch-part-1/) on Azavea Blog. It is also one step closer approaching the ["breakable-toy"](https://github.com/aaronxsu/a-breakable-toy).
